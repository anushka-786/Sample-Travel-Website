I have made this website by taking help from a tutorial to clear my HTML and CSS concepts.

In this sample website there are 2 folders and 4 files are listed below:

1. index.html--> In this file I have made home page of the website in which header, sections and footer are being covered.

2. about.html--> In this file I have written things about travel, and I have made sample button also to contact.

3. contact.html--> In this file I have made two sections are as follows: 1. Address of the sample company. 2. Sample form to contact with the company.

4. style.css--> In this file I have written css code of all the three above mentioned files.

That's it.
